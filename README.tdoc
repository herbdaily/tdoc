== Test oriented documentation

Tdoc combines rdoc, test::unit and shoulda, and concepts from rubytestdoc.

- Test/doc files map to Test::Unit::TestCase classes with a single context
- tdoc parses each file for the following directives:
  - tdoc_require
  - tdoc_context
  - tdoc_setup
  - example(s)

  tdoc_require: rubygems

  examples:
    
    >> "asdf"
    -> "asdf"
